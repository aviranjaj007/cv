<h2>AbouT Me: </h2>
<p class="about"> 
    I started my school life from <strong> <a href="https://kakdwip-shishu-shikshayatan-high-school.business.site/"> Kakdwip Shishu Shikshayatan High School.</a></strong>
      There is an emotion involved with my writing since school. <br>
       If I don't write much in school life, I write a lot in college life  
        My college was <strong> <a href="https://collegedunia.com/college/325-asutosh-college-kolkata"> Ashutosh College.</a></strong>  
        by the way,<br> this is a small effort to get my writing out to everyone.
